    "# = It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.\n",
    "#  Inheritance is a fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that enables a new class to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. This feature promotes code reusability and creates a parent-child relationship between classes.\n",
    "#  In inheritance, the child class acquires the properties and can access all the data members and functions defined in the parent class.\n",
    "#  Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure. \n",
    "#  Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance.\n",
    "#  Inheritance provides several advantages including reusability, saving time and effort, data hiding, extensibility, easy understandability, and reliability. An abstract class serves as a base class that cannot be instantiated on its own but provides common functionality to derived classes.\n",
    "#  mechanism of reusing and extending existing classes without modifying them, thus producing hierarchical relationships between them. Inheritance is almost like embedding an object into a class.\n",

    "# Multiple inheritance: When a child class inherits from multiple parent class, it is called multiple inheritance.\n",
    "# Single-level inheritance supports code reusability by allowing subclasses to inherit and use properties and methods from their superclass without the need to rewrite the same code.\n",
    "# In multiple inheritance,the same code can be used for multiple classes and it can be easier to debug and maintain the code. It also allows for better abstraction and flexibility in the code, since it can be extended and modified in various ways.\n",
    "# eg.of single inheritance:\n",
    "# Animal and Dog classes: In this example, the Animal class is the superclass, and the Dog class is the subclass. The Dog class inherits properties and methods from the Animal class, such as the eat() method.\n",
    "# example of multiple inheritance is a class that inherits from both a \"Vehicle\" class and an \"Electricity-Powered\" class, to create a new class called \"Electric Vehicle\". This class would have access to both the properties and methods of its parent classes.\n",
